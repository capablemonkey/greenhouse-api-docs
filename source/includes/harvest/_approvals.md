Endpoint may create or replace the entirety of an approval flow on a certain job or offer. If no approval flow exists, it will create it. Otherwise, it will modify the existing one. The priority of the approver group is implied by the order of the approver_groups element, with the first receiving first priority. Approvers who already exist in the group with matching priority will remain unchanged, approvers who are not included will be removed, and new approvers will be added. If modifying an approval that has been started, this endpoint will restart it, which will remove previous approvals, and notify the first group that an approval is due. Approvals in the rejected or approved state can not be modified by this endpoint.
