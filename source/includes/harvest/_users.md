\* - If the employee_id feature is not enabled for your organization, attempting to edit this field will raise an API Error. The "employee_id" element exists in both the "user" element as a look-up mechanism and in the "payload" element as a patching mechanism.

### Custom Field Parameters

The custom field parameter structure is different in the PATCH method than in GET methods and responses. Certain type of custom fields require different elements to be included, while deleting a field requires a specific argument. What follows is the description of each item in a custom field element and what is required depending on the type.

| Parameter    | Required for                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id           | all                          | The custom field id for this particular custom field. One of this or name_key is required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| name_key     | all                          | The field key for this custom field. This can be found in Greenhouse while editing custom options as "Immutable Field Key". This or id is required for all custom field elements.                                                                                                                                 |
| value        | all                          | The value field contains the new custom field value. In most cases this will be a string or a number. In the case of single-select or multi-select custom fields, this will be a custom field option id or an array of custom field option ids, respectively. |
| delete_value | n/a                          | When this element is included with a value of `"true"` (note, string true, not boolean true) the custom field value will be removed from Greenhouse. Note that updating a custom field value to nil or a blank string will not work, as validations require these to be non-blank values.                           |

\* At this time, user attributes only supports the following field types: single_select, multi_select, yes_no, and user

Disable a user. This endpoint allows you to disable a user via their Greenhouse user id, their internal employee id, or their e-mail address in Greenhouse. Any of the e-mail addresses tied to the user's account can be used. The user information must be provided in a JSON body. Only one of user_id, employee_id (if available), or e-mail address may be provided. Employee id or e-mail address must be a string. User ID must be a number. It is safe to call this method on a user that is currently disabled. If the user is already disabled, nothing happens.

Changes the permissions user level, i.e. Site Admin, Job Admin, Basic user

This endpoint will only convert the user to a Basic user. Other permission levels are not supported due to security constraints. This means changing the user permission level is not reversible through this endpoint.

When converting a user’s permission level to Basic, any previously assigned job-based, developer, or user-specific permissions will be removed. Note that this will remove the user from assigned roles on any jobs, e.g. Recruiter or Coordinator. This will also remove the user from any outstanding approval flows.

On-Behalf-Of | ID of the user issuing this request. Required for auditing purposes.

### JSON Body Parameters

Parameter | Required | Type | Description
--------- | ----------- | ----------- | -----------
user | Yes | object | An object containing one of email, user_id, or employee_id fields.
email | No | string | The email address associated with the user. <br> One of email, user_id, or employee_id is required.
user_id | No | string | The ID of the user. <br> One of email, user_id, or employee_id is required.
employee_id | No | string | The external employee_id of the user. <br> One of email, user_id, or employee_id is required.
level | Yes | string | The permission level to be assigned to the user. <br> The only accepted value is “basic”. Other permission levels are not accepted due to security constraints.

Note: This endpoint accepts users with Job Admin or Site Admin permission levels. Basic users will be ignored and will return a 200 response.

### Custom Field Parameters

The custom field parameter structure is different in the POST method than in GET methods and responses. Certain type of custom fields require different elements to be included. What follows is the description of each item in a custom field element and what is required depending on the type.

## POST: Add E-mail Address To User

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/users/{id}/email_addresses'
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "On-Behalf-Of: {greenhouse user ID}"
-H "Authorization: Basic MGQwMzFkODIyN2VhZmE2MWRjMzc1YTZjMmUwNjdlMjQ6"
```

> The above command takes a JSON request, structured like this:

```json
{
  "email": "bob@email.org",
  "send_verification": true
}
```
> The above command returns a JSON response, structured like this:

```json
{
    "id": 898318,
    "user_id": 253818,
    "email": "bob@email.org",
    "verified": "false"
}
```

Creates a new unverified e-mail address on the given user. The address will not be considered verified until the user receives the verification e-mail and clicks on the link to verify the address. There is no method in the API to verify an e-mail address. This endpoint is also used to re-send a verification e-mail. The request body to do this is exactly the same. If an unverified e-mail is received with send_verification set to true, Greenhouse will attempt to re-send the verification e-mail. If you attempt this with a verified e-mail, nothing occurs.

### HTTP Request

`POST https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/users/{id}/email_addresses`

There are 3 successful response states for this endpoint.

* 201: A new e-mail address was received and created. This will be the response code regardless of the verification setting.
* 200: An e-mail was generated for an unverified e-mail address. This is the case if we attempt to re-send a verification e-mail to an unverified e-mail address.
* 204: A request was made which caused Greenhouse to do nothing. This will occur if you attempt to re-send a verification e-mail to an address that has already been verified or if you make a follow-up request to an unverified e-mail with send_verification set to false.
