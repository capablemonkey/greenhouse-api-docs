## DELETE: Destroy Openings

``` shell
curl -X DELETE 'https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/jobs/{job_id}/openings'
-H "On-Behalf-Of: {greenhouse user ID}"
-H "Authorization: Basic MGQwMzFkODIyN2VhZmE2MWRjMzc1YTZjMmUwNjdlMjQ6"
```

```json
{
    "ids": [123, 456, 789]
}
```

### HTTP Request

**DEPRECATED** ~~`DELETE https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/jobs/{job_id}/openings`~~

`DELETE https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v2/jobs/{job_id}/openings`


### Headers

Header | Description
--------- | -----------
On-Behalf-Of | ID of the user issuing this request. Required for auditing purposes.

### JSON Body Parameters

Parameter | Required | Type | Description
--------- | ----------- | ----------- | -----------
ids | yes | Array | An array of opening ids to delete. Important to note that these are not `opening_id` from the other endpoints, but the unique `id` identifier.

**Notes**: The v1 version of this endpoint has been deprecated because it allowed integrations to delete open or filled openings that were otherwise prevented by data validations in the Greenhouse Recruiting UI.

The v2 version of this endpoint only allows closed, unfilled openings to be deleted and respects data validation rules as they exist in Greenhouse Recruiting. When the v1 endpoint is deprecated, some integrations may experience errors if they relied on deleting active or filled openings. Since the behavior adheres to the data validation guidelines established in Greenhouse Recruiting, Greenhouse does not consider these issues a breaking change.

In the v2 version, response messages will include both IDs that were successfully deleted and any IDs that could not be deleted. Failed deletions can occur for a number of reasons, including the following examples:
- The provided ID does not exist
- The provided ID leads to an opening tied to an application or offer
- The opening is currently open for applications

If the organization has deactivated the ability to destroy openings or if the On-Behalf-Of User does not have the ability to edit the given job, a 403 error will be returned.

The v1 endpoint has been deactivated as of 11/21/2022. Customers or partners should begin using the v2 endpoint.

API keys that were granted access to the v1 endpoint will automatically have access to the v2 endpoint.

## PATCH: Edit Openings

``` shell
curl -X PATCH 'https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/jobs/{job_id}/openings/{d}'
-H "On-Behalf-Of: {greenhouse user ID}"
-H "Authorization: Basic MGQwMzFkODIyN2VhZmE2MWRjMzc1YTZjMmUwNjdlMjQ6"
```

```json
{
    "opening_id": "abc-123",
    "status": "closed",
    "close_reason_id": 1234,
    "custom_fields": [ { "id": 123, "value": "some value" } ]
}
```

### HTTP Request

`PATCH https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/jobs/{job_id}/openings/{id}`

### Headers

Header | Description
--------- | -----------
On-Behalf-Of | ID of the user issuing this request. Required for auditing purposes.

### URL Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
job_id | The ID of the job on which to add new openings.
id | The ID of the opening. Note this is the immutable internal id, and not the free-text "opening_id" from the JSON body.

### JSON Body Parameters

Parameter | Required | Type | Description
--------- | ----------- | ----------- | -----------
opening_id | no | string | This is a string that contains an opening_id. This may be a blank string. Changing an opening_id may re-trigger approvals. For approvals to start recruiting, this will reset approvals only if the job is in draft mode. If the job is open for hiring, these approvals will not reset. For official job approvals, this will reset approvals only if the job is open.
status | no | string | Accepts either "open" or "closed". This can be used to close an open opening with the word "closed" or to open a closed opening with the word "open". Official job approvals will be reset when opening a closed opening only if the Permission Policy named "Reopening a job with approval should require reapproval" is toggled on. If the last opening is closed, it will close the hiring plan.
close_reason_id | no | integer | When closing, you may provide a close_reason_id. Providing a close_reason_id without closing the opening will return an error.
custom_fields | no | array | Array of custom field objects containing updated values for custom fields on the opening. See the "Custom Field Object Parameters" section below for more details. Note: updating a custom field may reset official job approvals if this option is selected in the custom field settings page.

**Note**: If the job is closed at the same time the opening_id is changed, approvals will be ignored in favor of closing the opening.

### Custom Field Object Parameters

The custom field parameter structure is different in the PATCH method than in GET methods and responses. Certain types of custom fields require different elements to be included. See below for the description of each item in a custom field element and what is required depending on the type.

Parameter | Required for | Description
---------- | -------------- | ----------------
id | all | The custom field ID for this particular custom field.  One of this or `name_key` is required.
name_key | all | The name key for this custom field. This can be found in Greenhouse while editing custom options as `Immutable Field Key`. One of this or `id` is required.
value | all | The new custom field value.  In most cases this will be a string or a number.  In the case of single-select or multi-select custom fields, this will be a custom field option ID or an array of custom field option IDs, respectively. In the case of single-select fields, this can also be a string that matches an existing option's name exactly. See the [Custom Field Object for more details](#the-custom-field-object).
min_value | number_range, currency range | The minimum value for a range. Must be less than max_value.
max_value | number_range, currency_range | The maximum value for a range. Must be greater than min_value
unit | currency | This contains the currency unit for a currency custom field. It is only required when updating a currency custom field.  This should accept any 3-character currency code from the ISO-4217 standard.
delete_value  | n/a | When this element is included with a value of "true" (note, string true, not boolean true) the custom field value will be removed from Greenhouse.  Note that updating a custom field value to nil or a blank string will not work, as validations require these to be non-blank values. Required custom fields cannot be deleted and attempting to delete them will cause the request to fail.

> The above returns a JSON response, structured like this:

```
{
    "success": "true"
}
```

## POST: Create New Openings

``` shell
curl -X POST 'https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/jobs/{job_id}/openings'
-H "On-Behalf-Of: {greenhouse user ID}"
-H "Authorization: Basic MGQwMzFkODIyN2VhZmE2MWRjMzc1YTZjMmUwNjdlMjQ6"
```

```json
{
    "openings": [
      {
          "opening_id": "abc-123",
          "custom_fields": [ { "id": 123, "value": "some value" } ]
      },
      {"opening_id": null}
    ]
}
```

### HTTP Request

`POST https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/jobs/{job_id}/openings`

### Headers

Header | Description
--------- | -----------
On-Behalf-Of | ID of the user issuing this request. Required for auditing purposes.

### URL Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
job_id | The ID of the job on which to add new openings.

### JSON Body Parameters

Parameter | Required | Type | Description
--------- | ----------- | ----------- | -----------
openings | yes | Array | This an array of hashes, which can contain an opening ID and custom fields.
openings.opening_id | yes | Array | This is a string that contains an opening_id. One new opening will be created for each hash element in the array. Opening ID is not required to have a string value and may be null.  Greenhouse has an internal limit of 100 open openings. If you attempt to create more than 100 openings in a single request, or if this request would create more than 100 open openings, the request will fail.
openings.custom_fields[] | No | Array | Array of custom field objects containing new custom field values. Passing an empty array does nothing. If you have any required custom fields configured for openings, they must be supplied for each new opening, or the request will fail. See the "Custom Field Object Parameters" section below for more details.

**Note**: Adding new openings may re-trigger approvals. For approvals to start recruiting, this will reset approvals only if the job is in draft mode. If the job is open for hiring, these approvals will not reset. For official job approvals, this will reset approvals only if the job is open.

### Custom Field Object Parameters

The custom field parameter structure is different in the POST method than in GET methods and responses. Certain types of custom fields require different elements to be included. See below for the description of each item in a custom field element and what is required depending on the type.
