### HTTP Request

`GET https://harvest.greenhouse.io/v1/departments`

### Querystring parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| *per_page | Return up to this number of objects per response. Must be an integer between 1 and 500. Defaults to 100.
| *page | A cursor for use in pagination.  Returns the n-th chunk of `per_page` objects.
| *skip_count | If `true`, the performance of retrieving departments will improve. This will remove `last` from the `link` response header.
